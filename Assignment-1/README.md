What is the birthday paradox?

The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, states that in a random group of 23 people,
there is about a 50 percent chance that two people have the same birthday.
The birthday paradox is strange, counter-intuitive and completely true.

If we consider 'N' people for our random experiment,
then the probability of finding a match is given as :

for(i=0; i<no_of_ppl; i++)
  Q(n) = Q(n) *  [(365-N)/365];

P(n) = 1 - Q(n);                                                                         //Expected Probability

Now,
to validate this problem we have run trials (should be more than 1000)
each having its own random experiment sets.
These random sets are generated by the 'rand()' function for the 
given number of people.

Then,
P(n) = No. of trials in which a match is found / Total no. of trials                    //Experimental Probability

Finally, 
after observing both the probabilities we find that both are approximately = 0.5.
i.e. a 50-50 chance of a birthday match.

Thus,
 the birthday paradox is really valid and the code written verifies the same.
